# DReLAB_tutorial
In this tutorial we show how to develop proficient botnet classifiers, and then how to use the DReLAB dataset to evade them. 

## Instructions
In order to execute this tutorial follow these few steps (Python 3.7):
1. Install the following libraries (we refer to their relative web pages for the installation guides):
  * Pandas: [Pandas Homepage](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)
  * Scikit-Learn 0.23: [Scikit-Learn HomePage](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  * Matplotlib: [Matplotlib HomePage](https://matplotlib.org/index.html)
2. Download the DReLAB dataset at the following link: [link to Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/nf22d786tj/1)
3. Download the Jupyter Notebook from this repository and place it at the same directory-level as the DReLAB/ directory which contains all the DReLAB data.
